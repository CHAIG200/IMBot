-------------------------------------------------
**IMBot** is a Discord server moderation bot that functions by detecting the intentions of a user using the bot. The developed intent-system is capable of comprehending commands in many different ways.
# Why rely on intention?
With an intent-system, users are not required to remember any specific syntax to allow the bot to function (**i.e.** a command prefix). For example, if a moderator on a server wants to ban a user, they can type:  
```
IMBot please ban ChrisFH#1769 for staff disrespect
```
or
```
IMBot Can you ban the user @Gisgar3#3047 for being a poopoo hed
```
Both solutions will equally work, as the intent-system was primarily developed to understand numerous forms of speech.
# What else can IMBot do?
**IMBot** comes with many extra *configurable* options, including the ability to record userdata (acquired through messages), NSFW-filtering, language translation and much more! As development continues, more features will be added for the overall user experience.
